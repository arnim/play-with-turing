    "For each sampler, we will use the same code to plot sampler paths. The block below loads the relevant libraries and defines a function for plotting the sampler's trajectory across the posterior.\n",

    "The Turing model definition used here is not especially practical, but it is designed in such a way as to produce visually interesting posterior surfaces to show how different samplers move along the distribution."
